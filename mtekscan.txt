NAME
       mtekscan - driver for MicroTek SCSI scanners

SYNOPSIS
       mtekscan <SCSI ID of scanner> [options]


DESCRIPTION
       mtekscan  is a driver that allows the use of MicroTek SCSI
       scanners with Linux.  It is a command  line  utility  that
       scans an image and writes the data to stdout or to a spec-
       ified  file.   Originally  developed  for  use  with   the
       MicroTek  ScanMaker  E6,  it  is  known to work with other
       MicoTek SCSI scanners as well. So far, it  has  been  suc-
       cessfully tested with a ScanMaker II, ScanMaker III, Scan-
       Maker E3, ScanMaker 35t+, and ScanMaker  E6,  as  well  as
       with an Adara ImageStar I, Genius ColorPage-SP2 and a Pri-
       max DeskScan Color.


OPTIONS
       All options and arguments have to be separated by  spaces;
       combining options like '-cpVt' is not allowed. If mutually
       exclusive options are specified on the same  command  line
       (like  '-c  -g')  the  last option overrides previous ones
       (unless explicitly stated otherwise, as for the -T and  -G
       options,  see below).  Note that some of the options might
       not be available, depending on the scanner model used.

       <SCSI ID of scanner>
              This is required for the OS/2 version, and must
              have your scanner's ID #; i.e. 6.

       -o <file>
              If this is specified, mtekscan writes  it's  output
              to <file> , instead of stdout.


       -f <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>
              Sets the scanning frame to the rectangle defined by
              the upper left corner <x1>,<y1> and the lower right
              corner  <x2>,<y2>.  The coordinates are measured in
              inch; the origin is at the top left corner  of  the
              scanning area.


       -r <resolution>
              Sets  the  scanning  resolution  (in  dpi).  As the
              MicroTek scanners only accept  resolution  settings
              in  1% or 5% steps of the maximum, the closest pos-
              sible value is selected.


       -b     Selects line art (black and white) scanning.


       -a     Selects halftone scanning. The document is dithered

              using  a  halftoning  pattern  that can be selected
              with the -H option.


       -g     Selects grayscale scanning.


       -c     Selects color scanning.


       -s <n> Sets the shadow adjustment value (black  level)  to
              <n>,  where  <n> is a decimal value in the range of
              0..255. All pixel values less than or equal to this
              value  are  set  to 0, and the remaining values are
              mapped into the range of 0 through 255.

              This option only works in multi-bit scanning  modes
              (color or grayscale).  The default value is 0.


       -l <n> Sets  the  highlight adjustment value (white level)
              to <n>, where <n> is a decimal value in  the  range
              of  0..255.  All pixel values greater than or equal
              to this value are set to  255,  and  the  remaining
              values  are mapped into the range of 0 through 255.

              This option only works in multi-bit scanning  modes
              (color or grayscale).  The default value is 255.


       -m <n> Sets the midtone adjustment value to <n>, where <n>
              is a decimal value in  the  range  of  0..255.  All
              pixel values larger than or equal to <n> are mapped
              into the range of 128 through 255, and  all  values
              less  than  <n>  are  mapped  into  the  range of 0
              through 127.

              This option only works in multi-bit scanning  modes
              (color or grayscale).  The default value is 128.


       -d <n> [ <n> <n> ]
              Selects  a  digital  brightness adjustment value of
              <n>, where <n> is a decimal value in the  range  of
              -100..100.  If  just  one  value is specified after
              this option, it determines the overall  brightness.
              If  three  values are specified, they determine the
              red, green, and blue channel brightness  adjustment
              individually.

              The default value is 0.


       -e <n> Sets   the   exposure   time   adjustment   (analog

              brightness adjustment) to <n>, where <n> is a deci-
              mal  value  usually  in  the range of -18..21 (some
              scanner models may accept higher values). Note that
              this  value  must be a multiple of 3, otherwise the
              closest possible value is selected.

              The default value is 0.


       -k <n> Sets the contrast adjustment to <n>, where <n> is a
              decimal value usually in the range of -42..49 (some
              scanner models may accept higher values). Note that
              this  value  must be a multiple of 7, otherwise the
              closest possible value is selected.

              The default value is 0.


       -G <n> [ <n> <n> ]
              Sets the gamma correction to <n>.  Specifying  just
              one  value  after  the  -G selects an overall gamma
              correction value; if  three  values  are  specified
              they select red, green and blue channel gamma indi-
              vidually.

              The default value is 1.0 for all three channels.


       -T <file>
              Loads the gamma correction  table(s)  from  <file>.
              If  this  is specified, it overrides any gamma set-
              tings specified with the -G option, even if the  -T
              option  is  specified  before the -G on the command
              line.

              The default is not to load correction tables from a
              file.


       -t     Selects  transparency  scanning  if  a transparency
              illuminator is installed.


       -n     Selects negative scanning (reverse colors).


       -H <n> Selects the built-in halftoning pattern <n>,  where
              <n>  is  a decimal value in the range of 0..11. The
              halftoning  pattern  defines  how  the   image   is
              dithered when scanning halftone images (option -a).


       -p     Enables prescan mode, resulting in faster but  less
              accurate scans.

       -v <n> Sets  the  scanning velocity to <n>, where <n> is a
              decimal value in the range of 1..7  (higher  values
              resulting  in  longer scan times). Setting a higher
              value can result in better quality if segment scan-
              ning is necessary (see option -B below).

              The default value is 1 (fastest).


       -B     Disables backtracking between scanning segments. If
              the transfer buffer of the generic SCSI  driver  is
              too  small,  the  scan process will be divided into
              several steps, or segments. Usually, the scan  head
              will  move  a bit backwards before beginning with a
              new segment. This can  be  disabled  by  specifying
              this  switch, resulting in faster but less accurate
              scans.


       -C     Disables the recalibration at the start of a  scan.
              This  results  in  much  shorter scanning times but
              less quality.

              Note that specifying this option causes a SCSI  bus
              lock-up  if the scanner did not calibrate itself at
              least once (e.g. if the scanner was  just  switched
              on).  At  least one scan must be made with calibra-
              tion enabled before this option can be used.


       -P     Same as '-p -C' (see above).


       -V     Verbose mode. Scanner settings and progress  infor-
              mation is written to stderr.


       -i     Shows  options  supported  by  the scanner in short
              format. The first values are the  maximum  document
              size and resolution, and the number of contrast and
              exposure time values accepted, followed by  a  list
              of  option  letters  supported by the scanner. This
              information is intended for use  with  a  graphical
              scanning frontend.


       -I     Shows internal scanner data in long, human-readable
              format.


       -S     Perform a self-test of  the  scanner  hardware  and
              exit.

BUGS
       mtekscan can cause kernel panics, system crashes, SCSI bus
       lock-ups  and various other nasty things. Really.  Select-
       ing a negative brightness value with the  -d  option  pro-
       duces  strange (and definitely wrong) results, at least on
       a ScanMaker E6. Specifying different brightness adjustment
       values for the red, green, and blue channels does not have
       the desired effect but just affects the overall brightness
       (again,  at  least on an E6). And probably there's a thou-
       sand more.
