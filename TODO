Things I plan to add/improve/fix in future releases:

- Add support for multi-bit formats other than 8 bpp (4/10/12 bpp)

- Allow specification of scanning frame and paper length in units other
  than inch (cm, mm, point, pixel)

- Support pixel as internal frame size setting unit (scanning frame
  specification is not very accurate now, especially if FIX_FRAMESIZE must
  be set to 1)

- Add support for automatic document feeder (ADF)

- Support downloading of user defined halftone patterns

~ Allow different contrast/exposure/shadow/midtone/highlight/brightness
  settings for R, G and B channels.

- Negative values for digital brightness adjustment produce very strange
  results.

- Allow specifying an option file containing commandline switches.

- Fix SCSI bus lockup when scanning without prior calibration 
  (if not possible, add a switch to perform a "dummy scan", i.e. a START SCAN 
  immediately followed by a STOP SCAN, to force a calibration).
  Maybe create a file in /tmp that indicates that a calibration was done?

- Add autodetection of scanner device (through /proc/scsi/scsi, perhaps)

~ Try to fix the "-n" switch for negative scanning (does not work
  on a 35t). (Got a workaround now with the INVERT_USING_GAMMA option).

- Check return value of lut_download().

- Blue values are not correct on an E6.

- Add software inter-/extrapolation, esp. for expanded resolution scans (to
  take care of vertically streched images in this mode.

- Write some simple tool to create gamma table files; maybe even some
  calibration tool for use with the test image supplied with some scanners
  (in the far, far future...).
