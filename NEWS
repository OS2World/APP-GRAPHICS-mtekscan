Version history:

v0.1 (10OCT1996)

  Initial release.

v0.2 (14APR1997)

  - Added 3-pass color scanning support!

  - Added retry loop to stop_scan() function, controlled by 
    MAX_WAIT_RETURN_RETRY and WAIT_RETURN_SLEEP_TIME (this is necessary
    for some (3-pass) scanner models that do not accept a STOP SCAN before
    the scan head returned to starting position between scanning passes,
    e.g. the ScanMaker II)

  - Improved error handling (catch SIGSEGV, check for linewidth <= 0).

  - Added option to disable vendor-ID check -- some non-MicroTek scanners
    (obviously) and the E3 need this, 'cause they don't report the vendor-ID
    as 'MICROTEK'.

  - Specifying a frame y-coordinate larger than the selected paper length
    is no longer possible. A negative paper length value selects the
    maximum document length as the paper length.

  - Images are written faster (replaced fprintf with fputc/fwrite)

  - Better error checking of commandline options

  - scsi_debug_level can now be set with SCSI_DEBUGLEVEL value in
    config.h, DEBUG option added for higher level functions

  - changed type of inquiry buffer in options.c (get_scanner_info())
    from char to unsigned char to avoid conversion problems
    (document size code of ScanMaker 35t was not recognized)

  - Added gamma table downloading and gamma correction (using gamma tables,
    commanline option '-G')

  - Added option to read gamma table(s) from file ('-T')
    (Note: gamma tables have not been tested with sizes > 256 entries;
    the E6 does not support larger tables)

  - Added compile time option to invert scanned image using gamma
    tables instead of the scanner´s built-in negative scanning option

  - Added scanner selftest function (commandline option '-S')

  - Added MODE SENSE 1 command; digital brightness adjustment can
    now be specified separately for red/green/blue channels using
    this function (at least that´s how it should work; the E6 seems
    to ignore these settings....)

  - Fixed a bug in the code that determines the scsi buffer size

  - Wrote a manpage
